2002 Tesla Motors 2004 and SolarCity 2006 Zip2 Musk and his brother Kimbal founded Zip2 in 1995 an internet company They did so with investments from a group of business angels One of the things the

board members agreed Compaq bought Zip2 for 307 million American dollars of which 7 went to Musk amounting to 22 million dollars Xcom and PayPal In March of 1999 Musk founded Xcom an online payment platform He invested 10 million in it A year later the company merged with Confinity which had its own payment platform named PayPal The merged company focused on the services PayPal already had and

project to have a small experimental greenhouse with food crops land on Mars to generate public interest in space exploration In October of 2001 Musk Jim Cantrell and Adeo Ressi travelled to Moscow to purchase old ICBMs that could shoot things into space Elon Musk quotes When something is important enough you do it even if the odds are not in your favor If you get up in the morning and think the future is going to be better it is a bright day Otherwise its not There have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live Why do you want to live Whats the point What inspires you What do you love about the future If the future does not include being out there among the stars and being a multiplanet species I find that incredibly depressing When Henry Ford made cheap reliable cars people said Nah whats wrong with a horse That was a huge bet he made and it worked Persistence is very important You should not give up unless you are forced to give up Its OK to have your eggs in one basket as long as you control what happens to that basket Failure is an option here If things are not failing you are not innovating enough Brand is just a perception and perception will match reality over time Sometimes it will be ahead other times it will be behind But brand is simply a collective impression some have about a product Starting and growing a business is as much about the innovation drive and determination of the people who do it as it is about the product they sell Were going to make it happen As God is my bloody witness Im hellbent on making it work The first step is to establish that something is possible then probability will occur People work better when they know what the goal is and why It is important that people look forward to coming to work in the morning and enjoy working I could either watch it happen or be a part of it Publications and Books by Elon Musk 2018 Making life multiplanetary New Space 61 211 2017 Making humans a multiplanetary species New
